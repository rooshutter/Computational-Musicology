# Computational-Musicology

I chose a shared playlist between my siblings and I, called 'On the road (again)'. This is a playlist we used on vacation last year. Since my siblings and I all have a   different taste in music, does this playlist contains different kinds of music. I think it will be interesting to analyse this playlist. The groups to analyse differences between are the different people adding songs to the playlist, genres, albums and artists. I think there will be differences between the genres and artists, similarities between the people and I'm unsure about the albums. I think genre is the most important gap, because one person can also put songs from different genres in the playlist. I think it is interesting to discover the connecting between the genre and the people. I think Dolce Vite (Extended version) from Ryan Paris is an atypical song in the playlist, because it is quite a long songs and different from the rest. Some reoccuring aspects are that there are whole albums added to the playlist. I think it is interesting to discover more connections and differences of this playlist.
